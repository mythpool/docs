3. A wallet popup will appear asking you to approve the transaction.  
Please carefully review the total amount — this includes the **ticket cost** and a **small amount of SOL**.

> ⚠️ Note:  
> Every ticket purchase, regardless of the pool token, requires a small amount of SOL.  
> This is used to create a unique **PDA account** on-chain to store your ticket data.  
> Don’t worry — this SOL is **refundable** at the end of the pool via claiming rewards or redemption.


## ✅ Step 4: Purchase Success
