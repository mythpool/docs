# 🏆 Public Pool Rules

MythPool offers two types of public prize pools: **Daily Pool** and **Weekly Pool**, designed to reward all actively participating but non-winning users. The public pool is managed by the platform, and no separate creation is required. All eligible users can automatically participate.

Each pool will be drawn at a specified time, and a certain percentage of funds will be transferred into the public pool.

## 🕰️ Drawing Rules

During each pool's draw, the system will automatically transfer a portion of the funds into the public pool as prize pool funds. After each draw, all non-winning users can collect public pool tickets from the pool's homepage.

- **Daily Pool**: Drawn daily at 10:00 PM US Eastern Time.
- **Weekly Pool**: Drawn weekly on Sundays at 10:00 PM US Eastern Time.

## 🎟️ Ticket Claim Rules

All non-winning users can claim public pool tickets after the draw on the pool's homepage. The specific claiming process is as follows:

- Winning users **cannot claim** public pool tickets.
- Non-winning users can **manually claim** public pool tickets.
- Public pool tickets can be used to participate in future public pool draws.

## 📜 Claim Conditions

Users can only claim public pool tickets if they did not win the pool's prize. The specific claiming rules will follow platform announcements and updates.
