# 🎉 Project Overview

**MythPool** is a decentralized lottery platform built on **Solana** and powered by **Switchboard**. Anyone can create a lottery pool, invite friends to participate, and once all tickets are sold, the system automatically triggers a verifiable random draw using Switchboard VRF, ensuring absolute fairness and transparency.


## 🚀 What Makes MythPool Unique?

### ✅ Permissionless Pool Creation

Anyone can freely create a lottery pool without needing approval from any centralized authority — embracing true decentralization and openness.

### 🎯 Fairness Backed by Switchboard VRF

We integrate **Switchboard's Verifiable Random Function (VRF)** to securely generate random numbers for each draw. Once the ticket sales are complete, the system automatically requests Switchboard’s VRF, ensuring a trustless, automated, and tamper-proof drawing process.

### 🔍 Transparent and Verifiable On-Chain Data

Every action — from pool creation and ticket purchases to prize distribution — is recorded permanently on the Solana blockchain. Users can verify all operations via:

- **Smart Contract Monitoring**: Track contract activity using blockchain explorers such as [Solscan](https://solscan.io).
- **Transaction Hash Verification**: We provide all related transaction hashes so participants can validate every step of the process themselves.


## 🧾 Platform Fee Structure

MythPool collects a small percentage from each lottery pool to support ongoing platform operations, security audits, and marketing initiatives. All fees are transparent and recorded on-chain, with no hidden costs.


## 🛡️ Security & Trust

- All randomness is sourced from **audited, decentralized oracle infrastructure**.
- Lottery processes are strictly enforced by **immutable smart contracts**.
- Core contract code is fully [open-sourced](https://github.com/mythpool/contract) for community scrutiny.
- Additional modules will be open-sourced progressively after completion of **independent third-party security audits**.


## 📊 Fully On-Chain Data Storage

MythPool **does not rely on any centralized databases**. All critical data — including pool details, ticket purchases, and draw results — are stored entirely on the **Solana blockchain**, ensuring:

- Tamper-resistance  
- Permanent verifiability  
- True decentralization  

## 👥 Why We Built MythPool

Traditional lottery systems are often centralized, opaque, and prone to manipulation. MythPool aims to build a more transparent and trustworthy alternative:

- **Trustless**: No one can control or manipulate the result  
- **Transparent**: Every step is verifiable on-chain  
- **Community-driven**: Anyone can create and manage their own lottery pool  


## 📌 Our Vision

We aim to reshape the lottery industry using the power of Web3 by:

- 🌍 Creating a platform where anyone, anywhere, can participate or launch a lottery
- 🧩 Making fairness, transparency, and randomness a technical guarantee—not a matter of trust
- 👥 Empowering communities to govern and maintain the platform through DAO initiatives

Let’s build a fairer, more open decentralized lottery ecosystem — together.
