# 🏗️ Pool Creation Airdrop Rules

To encourage users to actively create lottery pools, **MythPool** introduces a **pool creation airdrop reward mechanism**. When users create a pool for a **specific supported token** (currently **USDC**), the platform will issue an airdrop based on the **total value of the pool**.

## 🎁 Airdrop Calculation

- Currently supported token for airdrops: **USDC**
- Airdrop ratio: **1 USDC : 10 MYTH**
- Airdrops are calculated based on the **total value of the pool**  
  *(ticket price × number of tickets)*

### Example:

> You create a pool with a ticket price of **1 USDC**, and a total of **10 tickets**  
> The total pool value = 1 × 10 = **10 USDC**  
> You will receive an airdrop of: 10 × 10 = **100 MYTH**

## 📌 Claiming Rules

- This airdrop reward can be manually claimed by the creator from the pool list after the draw is completed.
- Only valid for pools using currently supported tokens (e.g., **USDC**)
- If a wallet creates multiple eligible pools, it can receive multiple airdrops (calculated separately per pool)

## ⚠️ Notes

- If the platform updates the supported token types for airdrops in the future, announcements will be made on the homepage and documentation
- If any suspicious or abusive behavior is detected (e.g., creating large pools without real participation), the platform reserves the right to revoke the airdrop

## 🎯 Why We Designed This

We aim to encourage community participation by incentivizing pool creation. This fosters a more active ecosystem, allowing users to co-build and share in the growth of the MythPool platform.
