# 📦 Contract IDL & Core Source Code

MythPool is committed to building a secure, transparent, and open decentralized platform. To support developer integration and transparency, we have open-sourced our core smart contract logic and Interface Definition Language (IDL). Additional components will be open-sourced gradually after undergoing professional security audits.


## 🔗 Contract IDL

You can find the Interface Definition Language (IDL) for our smart contracts on GitHub:

👉 **[https://github.com/mythpool/IDL](https://github.com/mythpool/IDL)**

### What is IDL?

IDL (Interface Definition Language) is a standardized way to describe a smart contract's interfaces. It provides:

- A clear definition of contract methods, parameter types, and events
- Easier integration with front-end applications or off-chain tools
- Compatibility with frameworks like Anchor for auto-generated client code

With IDL files, developers can easily interact with smart contracts without digging into the contract source code.


## 🧠 Core Smart Contract Source Code

We have open-sourced the core logic of our protocol, which is hosted on GitHub:

👉 **[https://github.com/mythpool/contract](https://github.com/mythpool/contract)**

### The current repository includes:

- 🎯 Core lottery pool operations: creation, participation, drawing
- 📤 Public pool reward distribution logic
- 🧪 Initial unit tests and contract structure documentation

⚠️ **Note:** For security reasons, only essential contract logic has been open-sourced at this stage. The remaining modules, including backend services and advanced features, will be released after passing third-party security audits.


## 👨‍💻 Developer Guide

We welcome all Web3 developers to join the MythPool ecosystem:
