# üéüÔ∏è What is a Regular Pool

A regular pool is a lottery pool created voluntarily by users, with a clear ticket price, ticket count, and expiration time. Users can freely choose the ticket price, ticket count, and expiration time when creating the regular pool. To prevent malicious pool creation, users are required to stake a certain amount when creating a pool.

## üõ°Ô∏è Staking Guarantee

When creating a regular pool, the user is required to stake **2%** of the pool amount as a security deposit. This is to prevent malicious pool creation and to ensure proper operation of the pool. The staked deposit will be automatically returned to the pool creator along with the creation reward when the draw is completed. If the pool reaches the minimum sales threshold and carries over to the next draw, the deposit will also be refunded.

## üí∞ Minimum Sales Quota

Regular pools have a minimum sales quota requirement, typically **60%** of the sales quota. The pool will only be drawn if it reaches this quota. If the pool does not meet the minimum sales quota, it will be automatically canceled, and the system will handle the cancellation accordingly.

## ‚ùå Pool Cancellation

If the pool does not meet the minimum sales quota, the system will automatically cancel the pool after it expires. After cancellation, the pool creator's staked amount will be deducted and converted into platform tokens (MYTH). These platform tokens will be airdropped to users who have purchased tickets for that pool.

## üéÅ Airdrop Compensation

When a pool is canceled, the system will convert the pool creator's staked guarantee into platform tokens (MYTH) and airdrop them based on the participation amount of each user. All users who have purchased tickets for that pool will receive platform token airdrop compensation based on their purchase proportion.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Reminders

- When creating a regular pool, make sure the ticket price, ticket count, and expiration time are reasonable and comply with platform rules.
- If the pool does not meet the minimum sales quota and is canceled, users will receive platform token airdrop compensation.
- The staked guarantee ensures the pool's validity, and pool creators should carefully consider the risks associated with the staked amount.
