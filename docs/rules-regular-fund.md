# üí∞ Standard Pool Prize Distribution Rules

Once a lottery pool has been successfully drawn, **the system will automatically handle prize distribution**. To ensure sustainable operation, community growth, and fair incentives, the fund distribution follows a clear structure:

## üìä Distribution Breakdown

| Recipient            | Percentage | Description                                                      |
|----------------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Platform Fee         | 5%         | For infrastructure maintenance and security audits              |
| Marketing Team       | 5%         | Supports promotions, community campaigns, and user acquisition  |
| Pool Creator Reward  | 6%         | Incentives for users who actively create pools                  |
| Daily Pool Allocation| 2%         | Distributed to the Daily Pool to encourage daily engagement     |
| Weekly Pool Allocation| 2%        | Distributed to the Weekly Pool to promote long-term involvement |
| Winners              | 80%        | The majority of the prize pool goes directly to the winners     |

These parameters will be adjusted according to the subsequent operation situation, and the benefits of the platform and the team will gradually decrease, giving the winners greater benefits.
## üéÅ Airdrop Incentive for Non-Winners

To encourage continued participation and reduce user loss, **non-winning users** will receive the following compensation:

### üé´ Airdrop Tickets & Platform Token Rewards:

- For every **1 USDC** spent on lottery tickets, users receive **10 Myth (platform token)** as an airdrop.
- Users will also receive **bonus tickets** to join special pools or public pools (such as Daily or Weekly Pools).
- These airdrops are **only available to non-winning users**. Winners are excluded from this bonus.


## ‚ùó Important Notes

- All distributions are executed **on-chain by smart contracts**, ensuring **immutability and full transparency**.
- Airdrops will be distributed within a defined timeframe after the drawing, and can be verified through the frontend interface or blockchain explorers.
- The value and utility of Myth tokens will grow as the platform evolves and expands its governance model.


Through this distribution mechanism, MythPool ensures **fair, transparent, and trustless prize management** while providing **long-term incentives** and **compensatory rewards** to strengthen participation and build a vibrant Web3 lottery ecosystem.
