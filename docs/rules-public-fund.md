# 💰 Public Pool Fund Allocation

The public pool is a reward mechanism for users who actively participate but do not win. All eligible users can equally participate in splitting the prize in the Daily Pool or Weekly Pool. To ensure the platform's sustainable development and increase the value of the platform token, the funds from the public pool will be allocated as follows:

## 📊 Allocation Structure:

- **5% — Platform Management Account**
  - This portion is allocated for daily platform maintenance, server costs, development expenses, and other infrastructure-related expenditures.
  
- **15% — Platform Liquidity Account**
  - This portion will be directly injected into the Myth trading pair on the platform, enhancing the liquidity of the platform token and supporting the long-term value growth of Myth.

- **80% — Winning Users of the Public Pool**
  - This portion of the funds will be allocated to the sole winner. The winner is determined based on predefined rules using a random number generated by Switchboard, ensuring fairness and transparency.

## 📝 Additional Notes:

- All fund flows **can be queried and verified on the Solana blockchain**, ensuring transparency and traceability of the allocation.
- Users do not need to take additional actions to participate in the public pool; eligible users will automatically qualify for the distribution.
- The prize pool of the Public Pool is primarily funded by donations from the Regular Pools.
