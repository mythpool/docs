# 🎉 Public Pool Drawing Rules

**MythPool** offers two types of **Public Pools** to reward all users who actively participate in lotteries but do not win. These pools are operated by the platform, and eligible users are automatically included without needing to create a new pool.

## 🕒 Public Pool Types & Drawing Times

- **Daily Pool**
  - Drawing Time: **Every day at 10 PM (ET)**
  - Designed to reward active users with frequent chances to win.

- **Weekly Pool**
  - Drawing Time: **Every Sunday at 10 PM (ET)**
  - Offers larger rewards for users who regularly participate.

## 🎁 Who Can Join?

Any user who **purchases a ticket but does not win** in any lottery pool will automatically qualify for the public pool draws.

As long as you've participated, even without winning, you’re not left empty-handed. You'll automatically receive:

- **Daily Pool participation rights**
- **Weekly Pool participation rights**
- **Myth token airdrop incentives** (See the Fund Distribution Rules for details)

## 🛡️ Fair and Transparent Drawing Process

- All public pool draws use **Switchboard's Verifiable Random Function (VRF)** to ensure complete fairness and transparency.
- The drawing process is fully executed on-chain, and all results are verifiable by anyone.

## 💡 Why Public Pools?

Traditional lotteries leave non-winners with nothing. MythPool aims to provide ongoing motivation and rewards to every participant:

- **Encourages platform engagement and user retention**
- **Boosts morale and satisfaction for non-winning users**
- **Creates a more engaging and community-driven lottery experience**
