# 🎁 Airdrop Rules for Purchases

To encourage platform activity and reward users, we have set up an airdrop rule for specific token pools. You can see the available airdrop rewards on the platform page. Please note that airdrop rewards are not applicable to all pools, but only to specific token pools. Currently, the set token pool is **USDC**, meaning that users who participate in the **USDC** pool will be eligible for the airdrop reward.

## 📊 Airdrop Rules:

- **Airdrop Ratio**: For every **1 USDC** spent, you will receive **10 MYTH**.
- This airdrop reward is only available for participation in the **USDC** token pool.
- Users must manually claim the airdrop by visiting the corresponding pool homepage after purchasing tickets.
- Airdrop rewards will be distributed along with the rewards from the public pool lottery, and users can claim them after the pool ends.

## 🚫 Airdrop Claim Restrictions:

- **Winners cannot claim airdrop rewards**: If you are a winner in a specific pool, you will not be eligible to claim the airdrop reward for that pool.

## 🛠️ How to Claim Airdrop Rewards:

1. Visit the platform's **purchase lottery page**.
2. Choose to participate in the eligible token pool (e.g., the **USDC** pool).
3. After purchasing, the system will prompt you to visit the pool homepage to claim the airdrop reward.
4. After the pool ends, visit the pool homepage to claim your airdrop rewards.

## 🎯 Goal

With this airdrop rule, we aim to encourage more user participation, increase platform activity, and ensure that every user can feel the rewards from the platform.
