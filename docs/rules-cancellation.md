# ❌ Pool Cancellation Policy

In **MythPool**, a lottery pool will be **automatically canceled** if it does not meet the minimum ticket sales threshold within the specified expiration time. In such cases, participants will receive a **compensation airdrop**, not a purchase-based airdrop.


## 🕒 Conditions for Pool Cancellation

- The pool reaches its **expiration time** (set by the creator during pool creation)
- The pool fails to reach the **minimum sales threshold** set by the platform  
  - Currently set at **60%**


## 📦 What Happens After Cancellation?

### 🧾 Creator's Stake Handling

- The stake deposited by the pool creator **will not be refunded**
- It will be **converted into MYTH tokens**
- These tokens are then **evenly distributed** to all users who purchased tickets,  
  **proportional to their ticket purchase value**


## 🎁 Compensation Airdrop (Not Purchase Airdrop)

- All users who bought tickets in the canceled pool **will receive MYTH tokens**
- This is a **compensation airdrop**, NOT a reward based on ticket spending
- Users who won’t be able to claim regular purchase airdrops **can still claim this compensation**

### 🧭 How to Claim?

- The airdrop **must be claimed manually**
- Navigate to the **lottery purchase page**, then go to the **pool details page**
- The compensation airdrop can be claimed together with **public pool ticket rewards**, if applicable

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- Canceled pools **will not proceed to drawing**
- All participants can **reclaim their ticket purchases**
- The MYTH compensation tokens are **distributed transparently**, verifiable on-chain
- If users don’t claim immediately, the reward remains **permanently claimable**
