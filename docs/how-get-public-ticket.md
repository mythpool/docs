# 🎟️ How to Get Public Pool Tickets

Public Pool tickets (such as **Daily Pool** and **Weekly Pool**) are special rewards given to users who actively participate in the Mythpool ecosystem. These tickets are **automatically distributed** based on your activity and are awarded **together with your purchase rewards**.

## 📌 When Are Public Pool Tickets Issued?

Public Pool tickets are **not claimed separately**. They are distributed at the **same time** as your purchase rewards:

- When you click **"Claim All Rewards"** on a pool page, the system will:
  - Claim your **purchase rewards** (if any)
  - Automatically assign you any **eligible Public Pool tickets**


## ⚠️ Important Notes

- If you are the **winner** of a lottery pool, you **cannot claim the purchase reward** for that pool.  
  → Therefore, you will **not receive Public Pool tickets** from that purchase.

  - ✅ If **not a winner** ➜ You can claim **Purchase Rewards + Public Pool Tickets**  
  - ❌ If **a winner** ➜ You only receive the winning prize, no additional rewards


## 🎯 Where to View Public Pool Tickets

Once claimed, you can view your Public Pool tickets by:

1. Going to the homepage and clicking **"My Tickets"**
2. Filtering by **Daily Pool** or **Weekly Pool**
3. Viewing your assigned ticket numbers and blockchain transaction info


## 💡 Tips
- Public pool lottery tickets are manually collected by the system on the pool homepage based on your participation, and do not need to be purchased separately.
- If you forget to collect the public pool lottery tickets, don't panic, you can come back to collect them at any time. The lottery tickets you collect will belong to the public pool of the day and the announcement pool of this week.
