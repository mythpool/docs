# 🎟️ How to Get Public Pool Tickets

Public Pool tickets (such as **Daily Pool** and **Weekly Pool**) are special rewards given to users who actively participate in the Mythpool ecosystem. These tickets are **automatically distributed** based on your activity and are awarded **together with your purchase rewards**.

## 📌 When Are Public Pool Tickets Issued?

Public Pool tickets are **not claimed separately**. They are distributed at the **same time** as your purchase rewards:

- When you click **"Claim All Rewards"** on a pool page, the system will:
  - Claim your **purchase rewards** (if any)
  - Automatically assign you any **eligible Public Pool tickets**


## ⚠️ Important Notes

- If you are the **winner** of a lottery pool, you **cannot claim the purchase reward** for that pool.  
  → Therefore, you will **not receive Public Pool tickets** from that purchase.

  - ✅ If **not a winner** ➜ You can claim **Purchase Rewards + Public Pool Tickets**  
  - ❌ If **a winner** ➜ You only receive the winning prize, no additional rewards


## 🎯 Where to View Public Pool Tickets

Once claimed, you can view your Public Pool tickets by:

1. Going to the homepage and clicking **"My Tickets"**
2. Filtering by **Daily Pool** or **Weekly Pool**
3. Viewing your assigned ticket numbers and blockchain transaction info


## 💡 Tips

- Public Pool tickets are **automatically distributed** based on your lottery participation — no need to buy them.
