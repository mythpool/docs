# 🗓️ Release Rules

According to the issuance instructions, our tokens will be released over a period of 4 years. To ensure the long-term stability of the platform and the healthy development of the token price, we have planned the release ratio to ensure market stability while incentivizing users.

## 🔓 Release Plan
- **Year 1: 25%**
- **Year 2: 25%**
- **Year 3: 30%**
- **Year 4: 20%**

## 📝 Detailed Explanation

1. **Year 1: 25% Release**  
   In the early stage of the platform's launch, 25% of the tokens will be released to incentivize early users, platform development, and market promotion. The smaller release amount ensures that the token supply does not increase too quickly, preventing market saturation.

2. **Year 2: 25% Release**  
   Continuing to provide sufficient incentives for users and the ecosystem, supporting the platform’s further development. A reduced release ratio helps stabilize the token price and gradually builds long-term growth for the platform.

3. **Year 3: 30% Release**  
   As the platform enters a more mature operational phase, the release ratio increases to 30%, supporting the expansion and enhancement of the platform. Sufficient tokens will be available for market deployment, airdrops, and other activities.

4. **Year 4: 20% Release**  
   In the final year, the release ratio decreases to 20%, ensuring that the platform token remains a stable asset for long-term operations. This supports the platform’s ongoing ecosystem development.

## 🔒 Lock-up Period and Liquidity Control

- Tokens released in the first two years will be subject to a lock-up mechanism, primarily for the founding team and early investors. This prevents a large amount of tokens from flooding the market too early, which could impact token value.
- To further stabilize the market, we will establish a liquidity pool on the platform, injecting some of the released tokens into the platform’s token trading pairs to maintain liquidity and market activity.

## 📈 Token Appreciation Potential

As the platform continues to grow and operate, the platform token (MYTH) will become an increasingly important asset. Users will need to consume platform tokens to create pools and stake platform tokens to participate in free lottery draws in public pools. Therefore, please take good care of your platform tokens.

As the system develops, the platform token will have significant appreciation potential. We recommend that users accumulate and hold platform tokens during the early stages of the platform to enjoy the future appreciation potential. 🌟
